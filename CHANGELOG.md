# Changelog

## [ADR-010] -- 2026-04-08

Cluster 3 renamed from "Documentation and Intent" to "Documentation Readiness".
Four dimensions renamed. Discoverability/Readability sub-category taxonomy introduced.

### Dimension renames
- 3.1: Component Description Coverage → Functional Intent Coverage
- 3.2: Documentation Structure and Machine-Readability → Documentation Indexing
- 3.4: Usage Guidance Formalisation → Usage Guidance Structure
- 3.5: Documentation Frame Metadata → In-File Documentation Structure
- 3.3 Intent Quality: unchanged (name already clear)

### Sub-category taxonomy
- Discoverability (3.1, 3.5): can the agent find the documentation? Co-location principle applies.
- Readability (3.2, 3.3, 3.4): given access, can the agent parse and use the documentation?

### Co-location principle scope confirmed
- Applies to 3.1 and 3.5 (Discoverability) only.
- Does not apply to 3.4. Carbon's 4/4 on 3.4 confirmed as legitimate: code-side structured guidance is the evidence source, not Figma accessibility.

### Files changed

## [v3.1] -- 2026-04-08

Benchmark re-runs with v3.1 prompt. Editorial workflow introduced.

### Audit runs
- MUI re-run: 63.6/100, not_ready, 4 blockers (up from 55.3; reflects prompt improvements, not system changes)
- Carbon re-run: 62.5/100, not_ready, 6 blockers
- Both runs use three-file output (audit + remediation + editorial JSON)

### Editorial workflow
- Editorial JSON pre-populated by audit engine during runs
- render-editorial.mjs: generates editable Markdown from editorial JSON
- compile-editorial.mjs: compiles edited Markdown back to JSON
- Read-only Markdown report retired (editorial JSON + dashboard replaces it)

### Naming
- ADR 010 naming applied to v3.1 prompt (Cluster 3 and four dimensions renamed)

### Files changed
- prompts/audit-prompt.md -- v3.1
- audit/material-ui/v3.1/ -- three output files (audit, remediation, editorial)
- audit/carbon/v3.1/ -- three output files (audit, remediation, editorial)
- scripts/render-editorial.mjs -- new
- scripts/compile-editorial.mjs -- new

## [v3.0] -- 2026-04-07

Three-file output architecture. Remediation framework formalised. Breaking schema change from v2.2.

### Architecture
- Audit output split into three files per run: [system]-audit.json (immutable scores), [system]-remediation.json (living remediation plan), [system]-editorial.json (prose overrides). Joined by audit_id.
- audit-schema.json bumped to v3.0. Remediation block removed entirely.
- remediation-schema.json v1.0 introduced at audit/schema/. Flat array of RemediationItem with priority_tier and remediation_type as required fields.
- editorial-schema.json scope clarified: prose overrides only.

### Remediation framework
- Three-bucket system (quick_wins, foundational_blockers, post_migration) retired.
- priority_tier (integer 1/2/3): 1 = necessary for agent readability, 2 = high leverage low effort, 3 = important but high effort.
- remediation_type (enum: relocate/refactor/rebuild): relocate = docs exist but not co-located, refactor = structure sound but docs missing, rebuild = structure poor, must fix before documenting.
- Sort order: priority_tier ascending, effort_estimate ascending, severity_rank descending.
- Co-location principle formalised: intent documentation must be declared and accessible from the component within the agent's toolchain. Two valid routes score equally.
- Usage guidance scoring confirmed: Carbon/MUI gap on 3.4 is a real quality difference, not a format artefact.
- Code-side rebuild threshold documented as draft heuristic pending developer validation.

### Release milestones restructured
- Releases 1.x--2.x: complete.
- Release 3.0: working pilot. Schema finalised, front-end built, tool works end-to-end.
- Release 4.0: first client application (Nordea). Adaptation sprint.

### Files changed
- audit/schema/audit-schema.json -- v3.0, remediation block removed
- audit/schema/remediation-schema.json -- new file, v1.0
- audit/schema/editorial-schema.json -- scope comment updated
- audit/material-ui/v2.2/mui-remediation-v2.2.json -- new file, extracted from audit JSON
- audit/carbon/v2.2/carbon-remediation-v2.2.json -- new file, extracted from audit JSON
- decisions/009-remediation-framework.md -- new ADR
- _index.md -- updated

## [v2.1] -- 2026-03-31

Schema iteration, two-phase audit, token reduction, documentation dimension update.

### Schema (Workstream 1)

- Schema aligned with v2.0 cluster-based output structure. Breaking change from
  v1.4: top-level `dimensions` replaced with `clusters` containing nested dimensions.
  Dimension scores are 0-4 integers, not 0-100.
- Remediation section added: quick_wins, foundational_blockers, post_migration.
  Each item has action, affected cluster/dimensions, effort estimate, ownership,
  and projected score improvement.
- severity_rank integer (0-3) mandatory on all findings for sorting.
- cluster_summary string mandatory on all clusters.
- Recommendations mandatory on all findings. No finding without a recommendation.
- Schema versioning rule updated: additive only within a major version.

### Two-phase audit (Workstream 2)

- Phase 1 (discovery): runs REST API calls, produces summary with component count,
  variable collection count, style count, page list, and per-cluster evidence
  availability. Presented to user before scoring.
- Phase 2 (targeted scoring): scores only dimensions with evidence. Skips entire
  clusters when no data. Single-component files skip statistical dimensions.
- Prompt rewritten from v1.4 to v2.1: two-phase procedure, cluster-based dimension
  references, expanded finding ID conventions for all 56 dimensions.

### Token reduction (Workstream 3)

- REST API response filtering: strip thumbnails, user metadata, version history,
  canvas positions, plugin data, export settings.
- get_variable_defs preferred over get_design_context for token-only MCP checks.
- Pre-compute cache pattern formalised: filtered REST API data cached in
  scripts/output/ before scoring engine runs.

### Documentation (Workstream 4)

- Dimension 3.3 (intent quality) scored against six-level documentation hierarchy:
  purpose, structure, intended behaviour, main use cases, error handling, edge cases.
  Components emphasise purpose/structure; patterns emphasise use cases/error handling.
- Patterns (loading, empty state, error recovery, validation, navigation, dismissal)
  are first-class audit targets alongside components.
- Cluster 4 renamed from "Craft Baseline" to "Design Quality Baseline".
- Documentation meta-principles added to CLAUDE.md: thorough, succinct, plain
  language, no duplication, document once and link, link to external frameworks.

### Files changed

- `audit/schema/audit-schema.json` -- rewritten for v2.1
- `prompts/audit-prompt.md` -- rewritten for v2.1
- `CLAUDE.md` -- documentation hierarchy, meta-principles, two-phase audit,
  Cluster 4 rename, schema versioning rule, cache reference
- `docs/audit-dimensions-v2.0.md` -- Dimension 3.3 expanded, Cluster 4 renamed
- `decisions/005-release-2.0-research-scan.md` -- Cluster 4 renamed
- `decisions/006-release-2.1-schema-iteration.md` -- new decision record

## [v2.0] -- 2026-03-31

Audit restructured to 7 clusters / 56 dimensions. Code-side token diff and
documentation frame reader added. Material UI 55.3/100 not ready, 10 blockers.

## [v1.4] -- 2026-03-30

Scoring methodology formalised and weight redistribution based on MUI v1.3 audit evidence.

### Scoring methodology

- Two-layer scoring system: sub-checks scored 0-4, dimension scores derived as
  average of sub-check scores x 25 (producing 0-100). Documented aggregation
  formula replaces v1.3 implicit scoring.
- 41 sub-checks defined across eleven dimensions. Each has an ID, description,
  data source, and scoring guidance.
- Override rule: any sub-check scoring 0 forces dimension severity to blocker
  regardless of composite score.
- Severity thresholds configurable per dimension with client overrides.
- v1.3 and v1.4 scores are not directly comparable due to methodology change.

### Weight redistribution

- Flat v1.3 weights replaced with three-tier system:
  - Tier 1 (agent cannot operate): token_architecture_depth (0.14),
    component_to_token_binding (0.14), component_description_coverage (0.12),
    documentation_quality (0.12). Total: 0.52.
  - Tier 2 (output quality degrades): token_implementation (0.10),
    alias_chain_integrity (0.08), accessibility_intent_coverage (0.08),
    platform_readiness_gap (0.07). Total: 0.33.
  - Tier 3 (system hygiene): primitive_naming (0.06),
    naming_convention_consistency (0.05), governance (0.04). Total: 0.15.
- Rationale: MUI v1.3 audit scored 72 on token implementation (v1.3 highest
  weight) but was not ready. The four blockers were all in dimensions that
  v1.3 weighted lowest. Weights now reflect observed impact on AI agent
  operability.

### Dimensions

- Dimension 8 renamed from web_readiness_gap to platform_readiness_gap.
  Platform-specific checks configured in client scoring config.
- Dimension 11 added: accessibility_intent_coverage with WCAG 2.2 Level AA
  default thresholds. Five sub-checks: focus states, touch targets, contrast
  derivability, keyboard navigation, accessibility mentions.

### Schema

- audit-schema.json (was audit-schema_v1.4.json): additive extension of v1.3.
- Added accessibility_intent_coverage and platform_readiness_gap dimension keys.
- Added sub_check_scores (optional) to DimensionEntry.
- Added phase_readiness_detail (optional) to Summary.
- Added AIC and PRG finding ID abbreviations.
- web_readiness_gap retained for backward compatibility, marked deprecated.

### Phase readiness

- phase_readiness_detail added as required output: blocking dimensions, warning
  dimensions, and explicit conditions for advancement.
- Phase readiness logic unchanged: pass (>= 75, 0 blockers), conditional_pass
  (>= 50, 0 blockers), not_ready (any blocker OR < 50).

### Config

- scoring-weights.json (was scoring-weights_v1.4.json): scoring_methodology,
  severity_thresholds, sub_checks blocks added. Dimension weights updated to
  tiered distribution.

## [v1.3] -- 2026-03-30

Audit complete: Material UI 44.3/100 not ready
Four blockers: token architecture depth, component-to-token binding, component description coverage, documentation quality
Key finding: 96.2% of existing MUI descriptions are code snippets not functional intent -- validates intent hypothesis
REST API required for all calls including component enumeration, not just variables
Three token scopes required: file_content:read, file_variables:read, library_content:read
Dimensions expanded from 10 to 11:
- Dimension 8 renamed from web-readiness gap to platform-readiness gap
- Dimension 11 added: accessibility intent coverage
- Intent defined explicitly as a standalone reference in CLAUDE.md

### Reorientation and planning

- Tool reoriented as client-agnostic. Core script, schema, and dimensions are not
  modified for client needs. Client adaptation uses a duplicate repo plus
  client-specific prompt and config variants.
- Target state defined: four-phase sequence (Audit, MVP, Beta, Stable). Phase 4 is
  the vision -- multiple agents active, designers define intent.
- Release plan documented in docs/release-plan.md covering Releases 1.3 to 3.0+.
- Test vehicle changed from Toimi to Material UI (Figma community file + GitHub repo)
  for Releases 1.3 through 2.1. Studio library follows in Release 2.1.

### Dimensions

- Dimension 10 added: documentation quality and intent coverage. Reads from component
  description field first; falls back to documentation frames if absent or thin.
- Full ten dimensions now defined in CLAUDE.md as stable reference. Prompt files
  reference them rather than redefining them.

### Schema

- audit-schema.json (originally audit-schema_v1.3.json) designed and written to disk.
- Findings now reference contract fields (type, level, path, field) for future
  codegen pipeline compatibility.
- contract_id gap identified: contracts currently referenced by path only. Adding a
  contract_id field to contracts is deferred to v1.4.
- Schema is additive-only from v1.3 onward. No breaking changes after this version.

### Repo and documentation

- CLAUDE.md updated to reflect client-agnostic architecture, ten dimensions, client
  adaptation instructions, and current state.
- CONTEXT.md updated with reorientation decisions and session learnings.
- decisions/ open items added covering skills review findings and gap analysis
  (Edenspiekermann, Firebender, MUI file confirmation, code token format,
  colleague schema alignment).
```

That is everything. Once you have added this to `CHANGELOG.md` and the `CONTEXT.md` update from the previous message, you have one clean commit that covers the full reorientation session.

## [v1.2] -- 2026-03-26

### Repo restructure

- Separated into audit/ (versioned audit outputs) and system/ (POC tokens, contracts, index, docs)
- Audit outputs moved to audit/toimi/v1.0/
- POC system files moved to system/contracts/, system/tokens/, system/index/, system/docs/
- Deleted superseded docs (architecture decisions, infrastructure guide) in favour of decisions/ ADRs and CONTEXT.md
- CLAUDE.md, CONTEXT.md, manifest.json updated with new paths
- docs/ at root reserved for GitHub Pages output in v1.3

### Planned audit changes

- Governance added as dimension 9, scored programmatically
- Full inspection of all 40 components (v1.0 inspected 6)
- Text and effect styles audited for hardcoded values
- ActionButton and Switch independently verified
- Spacing tokens audited post-rename

## [v1.0] -- 2026-03-26

### Audit scope

- Libraries: Toimi Foundation, Toimi Component
- Dimensions: 8 (token implementation, alias chain integrity, token architecture depth, primitive naming, component-to-token binding, component description coverage, naming convention consistency, web-readiness gap)
- Components deep-inspected: 6 of 40 (Button, TextInputSolid, Alert, Checkbox, Radio, Toggle)
- Governance: not scored in v1.0; identified as missing dimension during post-audit review

### Key findings

- Foundation scores 3.0 / 4.0. Token implementation and alias chain integrity are both 4/4. Spacing naming and primitive organisation drag the average.
- Component scores 1.8 / 4.0. Binding quality varies from excellent (Button) to minimal (Radio, Toggle). Description coverage is 15%, with 6 existing descriptions copied from M3/iOS.
- System score: 2.1 / 4.0 (53% AI-ready)
